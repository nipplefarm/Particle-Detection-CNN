# Image Classification Project

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into three categories: particle, hole, and smear. The model is trained and evaluated using TensorFlow and leverages GPU acceleration for faster training.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing TFRecord files for training and validation datasets.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing Python scripts for parsing data, training the model, and evaluating the model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: This file.
